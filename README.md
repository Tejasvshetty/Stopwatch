About
This is a fullstack application that allows a user to create multiple stopwatches to get keep track of time spent on tasks. I made it to be more precise on keeping track of my chargeable/productive time. I used MongoDB, EJS, Javascript, and Express in making this application. This was my first foray into making a full stack web application. Special thanks to the 100Devs Bootcamp for the starting point. I had to do a lot of research while making this project. When you click start from one time to another, the first timer stops and the second timer starts. I had to learn how to use Web Workers in order to let the timers run in the background. As well, it took me a bit to make sure the website works on both Apple and Android devices.
